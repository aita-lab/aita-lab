- About [Expert Systems With Applications (ESWA)](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/expert-systems-with-applications): Expert Systems With Applications is a refereed international journal whose focus is on exchanging information relating to expert and intelligent systems applied in industry, government, and universities worldwide. The thrust of the journal is to publish original papers dealing with the design, development, testing, implementation, and/or management of expert and intelligent systems, and also to provide practical guidelines in the development and management of these systems. The journal will publish papers in expert and intelligent systems technology and application in the areas of, but not limited to: finance, accounting, engineering, marketing, auditing, law, procurement and contracting, project management, risk assessment, information management, information retrieval, crisis management, stock trading, strategic management, network management, telecommunications, space education, intelligent front ends, intelligent database management systems, medicine, chemistry, human resources management, human capital, business, production management, archaeology, economics and energy. Papers in multi-agent systems, knowledge management, neural networks, knowledge discovery, data and text mining, multimedia mining, and genetic algorithms will also be published in the journal. The journal no longer considers papers that contain applications to military/defense systems.

The traditional approach in this field relies on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract features from each video frame and employs a recurrent network to learn information between video frames. While demonstrating considerable success in colorization, most traditional CNNs suffer from a limited receptive field size, capturing local information within a fixed-sized window. Consequently, they struggle to directly grasp long-range dependencies or pixel relationships that span large image or video frame areas. To address this limitation, recent advancements in the field have leveraged Vision Transformer (ViT) and their variants to enhance performance. This article introduces Swin Transformer Exemplar-based Video Colorization (SwinTExCo), an end-to-end model for the video colorization process that incorporates the Swin Transformer architecture as the backbone. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms many other state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics. The achievements of this research have significant implications for the domain of documentary and history video restoration, contributing to the broader goal of preserving cultural heritage and facilitating a deeper understanding of historical events through enhanced audiovisual materials.
